# ERC721

Details of ERC721 can be found in [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

## Usage

To make a new erc721-like token, we should import erc721 at first:

```rust
#[metis_lang::contract]
pub mod contract {
    use ink_prelude::{
        string::String,
        vec::Vec,
    };
    use metis_erc721 as erc721;
    pub use metis_erc721::{
        Error,
        Result,
        TokenId,
    };
    use metis_lang::{
        import,
        metis,
    };

    /// A ERC721 contract.
    #[ink(storage)]
    #[import(erc721)]
    pub struct Erc721 {
        erc721: erc721::Data<Erc721>,
    }

    // other logics
}
```

Then add the event for erc721:

```rust
    /// Emitted when `token_id` token is transferred from `from` to `to`.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc721)]
    pub struct Transfer {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub from: Option<AccountId>,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub to: Option<AccountId>,
        pub token_id: TokenId,
    }

    /// Emitted when `owner` enables `approved` to manage the `token_id` token.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc721)]
    pub struct Approval {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub owner: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub spender: Option<AccountId>,
        pub token_id: TokenId,
    }

    /// Emitted when `owner` enables or disables (`approved`) `operator` to manage all of its assets.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc721)]
    pub struct ApprovalForAll {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub owner: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        pub approved: bool,
    }
```

Then implement the component:

```rust
    #[cfg(not(feature = "ink-as-dependency"))]
    impl erc721::Impl<Erc721> for Erc721 {
        /// Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting
        /// and burning.
        ///
        /// Calling conditions:
        ///
        /// - When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `from`'s `token_id` will be
        /// transferred to `to`.
        /// - When `from` is zero, `token_id` will be minted for `to`.
        /// - When `to` is zero, `from`'s `token_id` will be burned.
        /// - `from` and `to` are never both zero.
        fn _before_token_transfer(
            &mut self,
            _from: Option<AccountId>,
            _to: Option<AccountId>,
            _token_id: &TokenId,
        ) -> Result<()> {
            Ok(())
        }

        /// Base URI for computing `token_url`. If set, the resulting URI for each
        /// token will be the concatenation of the `baseURI` and the `token_id`. Empty
        /// by default, can be overriden in child contracts.
        fn _base_url(&self) -> String {
            String::from("https://test/")
        }
    }
```

impl the constructor for contract:

```rust
impl Erc721 {
        /// the constructor of the contract
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new(name: String, symbol: String) -> Self {
            let mut instance = Self {
                erc721: erc721::Data::new(),
            };

            erc721::Impl::init(&mut instance, name, symbol);

            // other logic

            instance
        }
  }
```

Then implement the messages for contract:

```rust
    impl Erc721 {
        /// Returns the name of the token.
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn name(&self) -> String {
            erc721::Impl::name(self)

In the end, we can add some other messages.

## Messages for Txs

### approve

Gives permission to `to` to transfer `token_id` token to another account.
The approval is cleared when the token is transferred.

Only a single account can be approved at a time, so approving the
zero address clears previous approvals.

Requirements:

- The caller must own the token or be an approved operator.
- `token_id` must exist.

Emits an `Approval` event.

```rust
    /// Gives permission to `to` to transfer `token_id` token to another account.
    /// The approval is cleared when the token is transferred.
    ///
    /// Only a single account can be approved at a time, so approving the
    /// zero address clears previous approvals.
    ///
    /// Requirements:
    ///
    /// - The caller must own the token or be an approved operator.
    /// - `token_id` must exist.
    ///
    /// Emits an `Approval` event.
    fn approve(&mut self, to: Option<E::AccountId>, token_id: &TokenId) {
        let owner = self.owner_of(token_id);
        let caller = Self::caller();

        assert!(
            to.is_none() || to.as_ref().unwrap() != &owner,
            "ERC721: approval to current owner"
        );

        assert!(
            caller == owner || self.is_approved_for_all(&owner, &caller),
            "ERC721: approve caller is not owner nor approved for all"
        );

        self._approve(to, token_id);
    }
```

### transfer_from

Transfers `token_id` token from `from` to `to`.

WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged,
use `safe_transfer_from` whenever possible.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `token_id` token must be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either `approve` or `set_approval_for_all`.

Emits a `Transfer` event.

```rust
    /// Transfers `token_id` token from `from` to `to`.
    ///
    /// WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged,

        from: E::AccountId,
        to: E::AccountId,
        token_id: TokenId,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        assert!(
            self._is_approved_or_owner(&Self::caller(), &token_id),
            "ERC721: transfer caller is not owner nor approved"
        );

        self._transfer(&from, &to, &token_id)
    }
```

### set_approval_for_all

Approve or remove `operator` as an operator for the caller.
Operators can call `transfer_from` or `safe_transfer_from` for
any token owned by the caller.

Requirements:

- The `operator` cannot be the caller.

Emits an `ApprovalForAll` event.

```rust
    /// Approve or remove `operator` as an operator for the caller.
    /// Operators can call `transfer_from` or `safe_transfer_from` for
    /// any token owned by the caller.
    ///
    /// Requirements:
    ///
    /// - The `operator` cannot be the caller.
    ///
    /// Emits an `ApprovalForAll` event.
    fn set_approval_for_all(&mut self, operator: E::AccountId, approved: bool) {
        let caller = Self::caller();
        assert!(operator != caller, "ERC721: approve to caller");

        self.get_mut()
            .set_approval_for_all(caller.clone(), operator.clone(), approved);
        self.emit_event_approval_for_all(caller, operator, approved);
    }
```

### safe_transfer_from

Safely transfers `token_id` token from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients are aware of the ERC721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `token_id` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be have been allowed to move this token by either `approve` or `set_approval_for_all`.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement `on_erc721_received`, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a `Transfer` event.

```rust
    /// Safely transfers `token_id` token from `from` to `to`,
    /// checking first that contract recipients are aware of 
    /// the ERC721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.
    ///

    /// - If the caller is not `from`, it must be have been allowed to
    ///   move this token by either `approve` or `set_approval_for_all`.
    /// - If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement

        from: E::AccountId,
        to: E::AccountId,
        token_id: TokenId,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        self.safe_transfer_from_with_data(from, to, token_id, Vec::default())
    }
```

### safe_transfer_from_with_data

Safely transfers `token_id` token from `from` to `to`.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `token_id` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either `approve` or `set_approval_for_all`.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement `on_erc721_received`, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a `Transfer` event.

```rust
    /// Safely transfers `token_id` token from `from` to `to`.

        self.get()
            .is_approved_for_all(owner.clone(), operator.clone())
    }
```

## APIs

If the contract need make some logic by token, developers can based on this apis:

- `_exists` : is a token_id exists
- `_mint`, `_safe_mint` and `_safe_mint_with_data` : mint token to a account with amount
- `_burn` : burn token from a account by amount

### _exists

Returns whether `token_id` exists.

Tokens can be managed by their owner or approved accounts via
`approve` or `set_approval_for_all`.

Tokens start existing when they are minted (`_mint`),
and stop existing when they are burned (`_burn`).

```rust
    /// Returns whether `token_id` exists.
    ///
    /// Tokens can be managed by their owner or approved accounts via
    /// `approve` or `set_approval_for_all`.
    ///
    /// Tokens start existing when they are minted (`_mint`),
    /// and stop existing when they are burned (`_burn`).
    fn _exists(&self, token_id: &TokenId) -> bool {
        match self.get().owners.get(token_id) {
            Some(_) => true,
            None => false,
        }
    }
```

### _mint

Mints `token_id` and transfers it to `to`.

> WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use `_safe_mint` whenever possible

Requirements:

- `token_id` must not exist.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.

Emits a `Transfer` event.

```rust
    /// Mints `token_id` and transfers it to `to`.
    ///
    /// WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use `_safe_mint` whenever possible
    ///
    /// Requirements:
    ///
    /// - `token_id` must not exist.
    /// - `to` cannot be the zero address.
    ///
    /// Emits a `Transfer` event.
    fn _mint(&mut self, to: &E::AccountId, token_id: &TokenId) -> Result<()> {
        assert!(
            *to != E::AccountId::default(),
            "ERC721: mint to the zero address"
        );
        assert!(!self._exists(token_id), "ERC721: token already minted");

        self._before_token_transfer(None, Some(to.clone()), token_id)?;

        self.get_mut().balance_inc(to);
        self.get_mut().owners.insert(token_id.clone(), to.clone());

        self.emit_event_transfer(None, Some(to.clone()), token_id.clone());

        Ok(())
    }
```

### _safe_mint

Safely mints `token_id` and transfers it to `to`.

Requirements:

- `token_id` must not exist.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement `on_erc721_received`, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a `Transfer` event.

```rust
    /// Safely mints `token_id` and transfers it to `to`.
    ///
    /// Requirements:
    ///
    /// - `token_id` must not exist.
    /// - If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement `on_erc721_received`,
    ///  which is called upon a safe transfer.
    ///
    /// Emits a `Transfer` event.
    fn _safe_mint(&mut self, to: E::AccountId, token_id: TokenId) -> Result<()> {
        self._safe_mint_with_data(to, token_id, Vec::default())
    }
```

### _safe_mint_with_data

Same as `_safe_mint`, with an additional `data` parameter which is forwarded in `on_erc721_received` to contract recipients.

```rust
    /// Same as `_safe_mint`, with an additional `data` parameter which is
    /// forwarded in `on_erc721_received` to contract recipients.
    fn _safe_mint_with_data(
        &mut self,
        to: E::AccountId,
        token_id: TokenId,
        data: Vec<u8>,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        self._mint(&to, &token_id)?;

        assert!(
            self._check_on_erc721_received(E::AccountId::default(), to, token_id, data),
            "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer"
        );

        Ok(())
    }
```

### _burn

Destroys `token_id`.
The approval is cleared when the token is burned.

Requirements:

- `token_id` must exist.

Emits a `Transfer` event.

```rust
    /// Destroys `token_id`.
    /// The approval is cleared when the token is burned.
    ///
    /// Requirements:
    ///
    /// - `token_id` must exist.
    ///
    /// Emits a `Transfer` event.
    fn _burn(&mut self, token_id: &TokenId) -> Result<()> {
        let owner = self.owner_of(token_id);

        self._before_token_transfer(Some(owner.clone()), None, token_id)?;

        // Clear approvals
        self._approve(None, token_id);

        self.get_mut().balance_dec(&owner);

        self.get_mut().owners.take(token_id);

        self.emit_event_transfer(Some(owner), None, *token_id);

        Ok(())
    }
```

## Hooks

ERC721 have two hooks : `_before_token_transfer` and `_base_url`:

### _before_token_transfer

Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting and burning.

Calling conditions:

- When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `from`'s `token_id` will be
transferred to `to`.
- When `from` is zero, `token_id` will be minted for `to`.
- When `to` is zero, `from`'s `token_id` will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.

```rust
    /// Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting
    /// and burning.
    ///
    /// Calling conditions:
    ///
    /// - When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `from`'s `token_id` will be
    /// transferred to `to`.
    /// - When `from` is zero, `token_id` will be minted for `to`.
    /// - When `to` is zero, `from`'s `token_id` will be burned.
    /// - `from` and `to` are never both zero.
    fn _before_token_transfer(
        &mut self,
        from: Option<E::AccountId>,
        to: Option<E::AccountId>,
        token_id: &TokenId,
    ) -> Result<()>;
```

### _base_url

Base URI for computing `token_url`. If set, the resulting URI for each
token will be the concatenation of the `baseURI` and the `token_id`. Empty
by default, can be overriden in child contracts.

```rust
    /// Base URI for computing `token_url`. If set, the resulting URI for each
    /// token will be the concatenation of the `baseURI` and the `token_id`. Empty
    /// by default, can be overriden in child contracts.
    fn _base_url(&self) -> String;
```

## Events

### Transfer

Emitted when `token_id` token is transferred from `from` to `to`.

```rust
    /// Emitted when `token_id` token is transferred from `from` to `to`.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc721)]
    pub struct Transfer {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub from: Option<AccountId>,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub to: Option<AccountId>,
        pub token_id: TokenId,
    }
```

### Approval

Emitted when `owner` enables `approved` to manage the `token_id` token.

```rust
    /// Emitted when `owner` enables `approved` to manage the `token_id` token.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc721)]
    pub struct Approval {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub owner: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub spender: Option<AccountId>,
        pub token_id: TokenId,
    }
```

### ApprovalForAll

Emitted when `owner` enables or disables (`approved`) `operator` to manage all of its assets.

```rust
    /// Emitted when `owner` enables or disables (`approved`) `operator` to
    /// manage all of its assets.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc721)]
    pub struct ApprovalForAll {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub owner: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        pub approved: bool,
    }
```
