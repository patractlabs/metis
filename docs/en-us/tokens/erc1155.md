# ERC1155

Details of ERC1155 can be found in [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155).

## Usage

To make a new erc1155-like token, we should import erc1155 at first:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

#[metis_lang::contract]
pub mod contract {
    pub use erc1155::{
        Error,
        Result,
        TokenId,
    };
    use metis_erc1155 as erc1155;
    use metis_lang::{
        import,
        metis,
    };

    #[ink(storage)]
    #[import(erc1155)]
    pub struct Erc1155 {
        erc1155: erc1155::Data<Erc1155>,
    }

    impl erc1155::Impl<Erc1155> for Erc1155 {}
}
```

Then add the event for erc1155:

```rust
    /// Emitted when `value` tokens of token type `id` are transferred from `from` to `to` by `operator`.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc1155)]
    pub struct TransferSingle {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub from: Option<AccountId>,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub to: Option<AccountId>,
        pub id: TokenId,
        pub value: Balance,
    }

    /// Equivalent to multiple `TransferSingle` events, where `operator`, `from` and `to` are the same for all
    /// transfers.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc1155)]
    pub struct TransferBatch {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub from: Option<AccountId>,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub to: Option<AccountId>,
        pub id: Vec<TokenId>,
        pub value: Vec<Balance>,
    }

    /// Emitted when `owner` enables or disables (`approved`) `operator` to manage all of its assets.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc1155)]
    pub struct ApprovalForAll {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub owner: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        pub approved: bool,
    }

    /// Emitted when the URI for token type `id` changes to `value`, if it is a non-programmatic URI.
    ///
    /// If an `URI` event was emitted for `id`, the standard
    /// https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata-extensions[guarantees] that `value` will equal the value
    /// returned by `uri`.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc1155)]
    pub struct Url {
        pub value: String,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub id: TokenId,
    }
```

impl the constructor for contract:

```rust
    impl Erc1155 {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new(url: String) -> Self {
            let mut instance = Self {
                erc1155: erc1155::Data::new(),
            };

            erc1155::Impl::init(&mut instance, url);
            instance
        }
    }
```

Then implement the messages for contract:

```rust
    impl Erc1155 {
        /// Returns the URI for token type `id`.
        ///
        /// This implementation returns the same URI for *all* token types. It relies

## Message for Querys

### url

Returns the URI for token type `id`.

This implementation returns the same URI for *all* token types. It relies on the token type ID substitution mechanism
[defined in the EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata).

Clients calling this function must replace the `\{id\}` substring with the actual token type ID.

## Hooks

### _before_token_transfer

Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting
and burning, as well as batched variants.

The same hook is called on both single and batched variants. For single
transfers, the length of the `id` and `amount` arrays will be 1.

Calling conditions (for each `id` and `amount` pair):

- When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens of token type `id` will be  transferred to `to`.
- When `from` is zero, `amount` tokens of token type `id` will be minted for `to`.
- when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens of token type `id` will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.
- `ids` and `amounts` have the same, non-zero length.

```rust
    /// Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting
    /// and burning, as well as batched variants.
    ///
    /// The same hook is called on both single and batched variants. For single
    /// transfers, the length of the `id` and `amount` arrays will be 1.
    ///
    /// Calling conditions (for each `id` and `amount` pair):

    /// will be burned.
    /// - `from` and `to` are never both zero.
    /// - `ids` and `amounts` have the same, non-zero length.
    fn _before_token_transfer(
        &mut self,
        _operator: &E::AccountId,
        _from: &Option<&E::AccountId>,
        _to: &Option<&E::AccountId>,
        _ids: &Vec<TokenId>,
        _amounts: &Vec<E::Balance>,
        _data: &Vec<u8>,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
```

## Events

### TransferSingle

Emitted when `value` tokens of token type `id` are transferred
from `from` to `to` by `operator`.

```rust
    /// Emitted when `value` tokens of token type `id` are transferred
    /// from `from` to `to` by `operator`.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc1155)]
    pub struct TransferSingle {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub from: Option<AccountId>,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub to: Option<AccountId>,
        pub id: TokenId,
        pub value: Balance,
    }
```

### TransferBatch

Equivalent to multiple `TransferSingle` events, where `operator`,
`from` and `to` are the same for all transfers.

```rust
    /// Equivalent to multiple `TransferSingle` events, where `operator`,
    /// `from` and `to` are the same for all transfers.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc1155)]
    pub struct TransferBatch {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub from: Option<AccountId>,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub to: Option<AccountId>,
        pub id: Vec<TokenId>,
        pub value: Vec<Balance>,
    }
```

### ApprovalForAll

Emitted when `owner` enables or disables (`approved`) `operator` to manage all of its assets.

```rust
    /// Emitted when `owner` enables or disables (`approved`)
    /// `operator` to manage all of its assets.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc1155)]
    pub struct ApprovalForAll {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub owner: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        pub approved: bool,
    }
```

### Url

Emitted when the URI for token type `id` changes to `value`, if it is a non-programmatic URI.

If an `URI` event was emitted for `id`, the standard
[eip-1155#metadata-extensions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata-extensions) that `value` will equal the value
returned by `uri`.

```rust
    /// Emitted when the URI for token type `id` changes to `value`, if it is a non-programmatic URI.
    ///
    /// If an `URI` event was emitted for `id`, the standard
    /// https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata-extensions[guarantees] that `value` will equal the value
    /// returned by `uri`.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc1155)]
    pub struct Url {
        pub value: String,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub id: TokenId,
    }
```
