# ERC777

Details of ERC777 can be found in [ERC777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777).

## Usage

To make a new erc777-like token, we should import erc777 at first:

```rust
#[metis_lang::contract]
pub mod erc777_contract {
    use super::super::behavior;
    pub use erc777::{
        Error,
        Result,
    };
    use metis_erc777 as erc777;
    use metis_lang::{
        import,
        metis,
    };

    #[ink(storage)]
    #[import(erc777)]
    pub struct Erc777 {
        erc777: erc777::Data<Erc777>,
    }

    // Note: Now version of metis not support auto impl for erc777
    #[cfg(not(feature = "ink-as-dependency"))]
    impl erc777::Impl<Erc777> for Erc777 {}
}
```

> Note: Now version of metis not support auto impl for erc777.
>
> Should add:
>
> ```rust
>    #[cfg(not(feature = "ink-as-dependency"))]
>    impl erc777::Impl<Erc777> for Erc777 {}
> ```

Then add the event for erc777:

```rust
     /// Event emitted when a token transfer occurs.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc777)]
    pub struct Transfer {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub from: Option<AccountId>,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub to: Option<AccountId>,
        pub value: Balance,
    }

    /// Event emitted when an approval occurs that `spender` is allowed to withdraw
    /// up to the amount of `value` tokens from `owner`.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc777)]
    pub struct Approval {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub owner: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub spender: AccountId,
        pub value: Balance,
    }

    /// Indicate a send of `amount` of tokens from the `from` address to the `to`
    /// address by the `operator` address.
    /// 
    /// NOTE: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of
    /// a send or an ERC-20 transfer process.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc777)]
    pub struct Sent {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub from: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub to: AccountId,
        pub amount: Balance,
        pub data: Vec<u8>,
        pub operator_data: Vec<u8>,
    }

    /// Indicate the minting of `amount` of tokens to the `to` address by
    /// the `operator` address.
    ///
    /// NOTE: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of a mint process.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc777)]
    pub struct Minted {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub to: AccountId,
        pub amount: Balance,
        pub data: Vec<u8>,
        pub operator_data: Vec<u8>,
    }

    /// Indicate the burning of `amount` of tokens from the `from` address
    /// by the `operator` address.
    /// 
    /// NOTE: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of a burn process.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc777)]
    pub struct Burned {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub from: AccountId,
        pub amount: Balance,
        pub data: Vec<u8>,
        pub operator_data: Vec<u8>,
    }

    /// Indicates the authorization of `operator` as an operator for `holder`.
    /// 
    /// NOTE: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside
    /// of an operator authorization process.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc777)]
    pub struct AuthorizedOperator {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub token_holder: AccountId,
    }

    /// Indicates the revocation of `operator` as an operator for `holder`.
    /// 
    /// NOTE: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside
    /// of an operator revocation process.
    #[ink(event)]
    #[metis(erc777)]
    pub struct RevokedOperator {
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub operator: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        pub token_holder: AccountId,
    }
```

impl the constructor for contract:

```rust
    impl Erc777 {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new(
            name: String,
            symbol: String,
            decimals: u8,
            initial_supply: Balance,
        ) -> Self {
            let mut instance = Self {
                erc777: erc777::Data::new(),
            };

            erc777::Impl::init(&mut instance, 
                name, symbol, decimals,
                initial_supply);

            // other logics
            instance
        }
    }

Then implement the messages for contract:

```rust
    impl Erc777 {
        /// Returns the name of the token.
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn name(&self) -> String {

In the end, we can add some other messages.

## Messages for Txs

### send

Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.

If send or receive hooks are registered for the caller and `recipient`,
the corresponding functions will be called with `data` and empty
`operator_data`. See `erc777_sender` and `erc777_recipient`.

Emits a `Sent` event.

Requirements

- the caller must have at least `amount` tokens.
- `recipient` cannot be the zero address.
- if `recipient` is a contract, it must implement the `erc777_recipient` interface.

```rust
    /// Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.
    ///
    /// If send or receive hooks are registered for the caller and `recipient`,
    /// the corresponding functions will be called with `data` and empty
    /// `operator_data`. See `erc777_sender` and `erc777_recipient`.
    ///
    /// Emits a `Sent` event.
    ///
    /// Requirements
    ///
    /// - the caller must have at least `amount` tokens.
    /// - `recipient` cannot be the zero address.
    /// - if `recipient` is a contract, it must implement the `erc777_recipient`
    /// interface.
    fn send(
        &mut self,
        recipient: E::AccountId,
        amount: E::Balance,
        data: Vec<u8>,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        self._send(
            Self::caller(),
            recipient,
            amount,
            data,
            Vec::default(),
            true,
        )
    }
```

### transfer

Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

Emits a `Transfer` event.

```rust
    /// Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.
    ///
    /// Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
    ///
    /// Emits a `Transfer` event.
    fn transfer(&mut self, recipient: &E::AccountId, amount: E::Balance) -> Result<()> {
        let null_account = &E::AccountId::default();
        let from = &Self::caller();

        if recipient == null_account {
            return Err(Error::AccountIsZero)
        }

        let null_data = &Vec::<u8>::default();

        self._call_tokens_to_send(
            &from,
            &Some(&from),
            &Some(&recipient),
            &amount,
            null_data,
            null_data,
        );

        self._move(&from, &from, &recipient, &amount, null_data, null_data)?;

        self._call_tokens_received(
            &from,
            &Some(&from),
            &Some(&recipient),
            &amount,
            null_data,
            null_data,
            false,
        );

        Ok(())
    }
```

### burn

Destroys `amount` tokens from the caller's account, reducing the
total supply.

If a send hook is registered for the caller, the corresponding function
will be called with `data` and empty `operator_data`. See `erc777_sender`.

Emits a `Burned` event.

Requirements

- the caller must have at least `amount` tokens.

```rust
    /// Destroys `amount` tokens from the caller's account, reducing the
    /// total supply.
    ///
    /// If a send hook is registered for the caller, the corresponding function
    /// will be called with `data` and empty `operator_data`. See `erc777_sender`.
    ///
    /// Emits a `Burned` event.
    ///
    /// Requirements

        self._burn(account, amount, data, operator_data)
    }
```

### approve

Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller's tokens.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk
that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate
transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the
desired value afterwards:
<https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729>

Emits an `Approval` event.

```

### transfer_from

Moves `amount` tokens from `sender` to `recipient` using the
allowance mechanism. `amount` is then deducted from the caller's
allowance.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

Emits a `Transfer` event.

```rust
    /// Moves `amount` tokens from `sender` to `recipient` using the

## Message for Querys

### name

Returns the name of the token.

```rust
    /// Returns the name of the token.
    fn name(&self) -> String {
        self.get().name().clone()
    }
```

### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the name.

```rust
    /// Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the name.
    fn symbol(&self) -> String {
        self.get().symbol().clone()
    }
```

### decimals

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
be displayed to a user as `5,05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei in ETH. This is the value `ERC20` uses, unless this function is
overridden;

> NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
> no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract

```rust
    /// Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
    /// For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
    /// be displayed to a user as `5,05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).
    ///

    ///
    /// NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
    /// no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract
    fn decimals(&self) -> u8 {
        self.get().decimals().clone()
    }
```

### granularity

Returns the smallest part of the token that is not divisible. This
means all token operations (creation, movement and destruction) must have
amounts that are a multiple of this number.

For most token contracts, this value will equal 1.

```rust
    /// Returns the smallest part of the token that is not divisible. This
    /// means all token operations (creation, movement and destruction) must have
    /// amounts that are a multiple of this number.
    ///
    /// For most token contracts, this value will equal 1.
    fn granularity(&self) -> E::Balance {
        E::Balance::from(1_u8)
    }
```

### total_supply

Returns the amount of tokens in existence.

```rust
    /// Returns the amount of tokens in existence.
    fn total_supply(&self) -> E::Balance {
        self.get().total_supply()
    }
```

### balance_of

Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.

```rust
    /// Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.
    fn balance_of(&self, account: &E::AccountId) -> E::Balance {
        self.get().balance_of(account)
    }
```

### is_operator_for

Returns true if an account is an operator of `token_holder`.
Operators can send and burn tokens on behalf of their owners. All
accounts are their own operator.

See `operator_send` and `operator_burn`.

```rust
    /// Returns true if an account is an operator of `token_holder`.
    /// Operators can send and burn tokens on behalf of their owners. All
    /// accounts are their own operator.
    ///
    /// See `operator_send` and `operator_burn`.
    fn is_operator_for(
        &self,
        operator: E::AccountId,
        token_holder: E::AccountId,
    ) -> bool {
        self.get().is_operator_for(&operator, &token_holder)
    }
```

### default_operators

Returns the list of default operators. These accounts are operators
for all token holders, even if `authorize_operator` was never called on
them.

This list is immutable, but individual holders may revoke these via
`revoke_operator`, in which case `is_operator_for` will return false.

```rust
    /// Returns the list of default operators. These accounts are operators
    /// for all token holders, even if `authorize_operator` was never called on
    /// them.
    ///
    /// This list is immutable, but individual holders may revoke these via
    /// `revoke_operator`, in which case `is_operator_for` will return false.
    fn default_operators(&self) -> Vec<E::AccountId> {
        self.get().default_operators_array.clone()
    }
```

### allowance

Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be
allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through `transfer_from`. This is
zero by default.

This value changes when `approve` or `transfer_from` are called.

```rust
    /// Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be
    /// allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through `transfer_from`. This is
    /// zero by default.
    ///
    /// This value changes when `approve` or `transfer_from` are called.
    fn allowance(&self, owner: &E::AccountId, spender: &E::AccountId) -> E::Balance {
        self.get().allowance(owner, spender)
    }
```

## Hooks

### _before_token_transfer

Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes
calls to `send`, `transfer`, `operator_send`, minting and burning.

Calling conditions:

- when `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
will be to transferred to `to`.
- when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens will be minted for `to`.
- when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.

```rust
    /// Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes
    /// calls to `send`, `transfer`, `operator_send`, minting and burning.
    ///
    /// Calling conditions:
    ///

    /// will be to transferred to `to`.
    /// - when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens will be minted for `to`.
    /// - when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens will be burned.
    /// - `from` and `to` are never both zero.
