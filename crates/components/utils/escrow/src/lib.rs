//! Escrow
//! Base escrow contract, holds funds designated for a payee until they
//! withdraw them.
//!
//! Intended usage: This contract (and derived escrow contracts) should be a
//! standalone contract, that only interacts with the contract that instantiated
//! it. That way, it is guaranteed that all Ether will be handled according to
//! the `Escrow` rules, and there is no need to check for payable functions or
//! transfers in the inheritance tree. The contract that uses the escrow as its
//! payment method should be its owner, and provide public methods redirecting
//! to the escrow's deposit and withdraw.
