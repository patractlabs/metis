# Metis

Metis is inspired by the [OpenZeppelin-Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) from the Ethereum ecosystem. Metis will develop the corresponding version of the ink! implementation for each newly generated ink! contract standard. Metis will be audited at the same time to ensure the security of the contract. Metis will also be able to be easily searched and downloaded just like Solidity development, and integrated into the developer's project as a Redspot plug-in.

To use the Metis, can see the [documentation](https://patractlabs.github.io/metis/overview.html).
